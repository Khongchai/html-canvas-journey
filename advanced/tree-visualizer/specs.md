# Tree Visaulizer Specs

1. 2 Panels: left - a visualizer; right - a text editor.
2. We inject a method, just like leetcode, and have people write some code.
3. When people hit execute, we run the injected code and use the returned TreeNode object to generate an animated tree.
4. We should allow people to scroll around and zoom in + out, so of course, we need webgl for this.
