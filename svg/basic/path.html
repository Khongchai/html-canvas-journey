    <!-- Notes for https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths -->
    <!-- <path> is the most general and the most powerful shape -->
    <!-- It can be used to create lines, curves, arcs, and more. -->
    <!-- A good understanding of this section is important when working with and debugging svg elements. -->
    <!-- Using a text editor for really complex shapes isn't really a good idea, but as mentioned earlier, the knowlege will come in handy when you debug. -->
    <svg width="1000" height="1000">
      <!-- These are the same -->
      <!-- <path d="M10 10 L90 10 L90 90 H10 L10 10" /> -->

      <!-- <path d="M10 10 H90 V90 H10 V10" /> -->

      <!-- Z is the close path command -->
      <!-- <path d="M10 10 H90 V90 H10 Z" /> -->

      <!-- We can also achieve the same thing with the relative command (lower case) -->
      <!-- <path d="M10 10 h80 v80 h-80 Z" /> -->

      <!-- Other than drawing straight lines, you can also draw curves with the path element -->
      <!-- <path

        stroke="black"
        fill="transparent"
      /> -->

      <!-- You can also use the S command, which is a reflection of the previous point and by putting in S, the coordinate is inferred automatically. -->
      <!-- <path
        d="M 10 80 C 40 10, 65 10, 95 80 S 150 150, 180 80"
